#GREETING APP [3.0.0]
- This app is intended to take input from a user and generate a personalized greeting per that input.

## USE OF THE APP
- This is a command line application that generates a greeting.

- The default greeting is "hello stanger" said by a cow. In order to get this result, the user must type "node cli.js" in the command line.
    > node cli.js

- In order to change the name in the greeting from "stranger" to something the user inputs, the user must type "--name:INPUT" after "node cli.js" in the command line, where input is the user's name of choice.
    > node cli.js --name:brigitte
 ________________
< hello brigitte >
 ----------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||

- In order to change the greeting from "hello" to something the user inputs, the user must type "--greeting:INPUT" after "node cli.js" in the command line, where input is the user's greeting of choice.
    > node cli.js --name:brigitte --greetings: hola
 ________________
< hola brigitte >
 ----------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||

- If the user prefers a greeting that is not said by a cow, the user can include "--plain"after "node cli.js" in the command line.
    > node cli.js --name:brigitte --greetings: hola --plain
hola brigitte

- The user can include all or none of inputs in any order and the app will still run (ex. "node cli.js --name:brigitte --greeting:hola --plain").
